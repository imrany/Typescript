# Learnt typescript
Typescript is a superset of javascript, it is static typed while javascript is dynamically typed. Meaning 
in typescript you can defined a variable's datatype hence making it strictly to that datatype, while in javascript is not a must to define the variable's datatype because javascript will know if a variable is a string or a number.

example:
in Typescript:
```typescript
    let name: string="imran"

```
in javascript:
```javascript
let name ="imran";
```
Typescript must be compiled to javascript since the browser cannot understand typescript.
 Typescript support static type this prevent errors
